# Project 1: Healthly & Lifestyle Choices Data Analysis 
## Uncovering the connection between daily habits and health outcomes through SQL-based data exploration

üìù Project Overview:
In this self-guided project, I analyzed a custom dataset of 1,000 surveyed individuals to explore the relationship between health indicators and lifestyle choices. Using SQL and Excel, I independently cleaned and transformed the data over two weeks to uncover key trends and metrics.

The analysis focused on identifying behaviors and patterns that could help a marketing team design targeted health campaigns. By surfacing insights into exercise frequency, sleep quality, diet, and other lifestyle factors, this project demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into meaningful business recommendations.
